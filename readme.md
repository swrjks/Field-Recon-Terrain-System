### Track(s) Chosen:
AI in Defense and Disaster Response

### Problem Statement:
**Defense personnel** and **disaster response teams** are often deployed in unfamiliar, high-risk terrains such as **hilly regions**, **dense forests**, or **disaster-hit zones**. In these situations, they lack access to **real-time terrain awareness** and face difficulties in **navigation** and **mission planning**. This increases operational risk, delays response times, and reduces mission efficiency. There is a strong need for a system that can provide accurate **terrain insights**, **intelligent navigation routes**, and **local area information** in real time.

### Proposed Solution:
The **Field Recon Terrain System (FRTS)** helps defense and disaster response **personnel** navigate and understand challenging terrains. Using **satellite imagery** and **elevation data**, we generate detailed **3D models** for interactive exploration. Our system integrates **AI pathfinding algorithms** to find the shortest and safest routes, while providing real-time contextual information like terrain types, hazards, and resources.

What makes our approach unique is the combination of **ground reality terrain modeling** and **AI-driven navigation**, enabling **personnel** to plan movements and access valuable **local intelligence**, such as wildlife habitats, and potential threats. The system works in both **online and offline modes**, ensuring reliability in remote areas.
